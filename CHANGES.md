# Change log for CommonPy

## Version 1.12.2

This release updates the versions of dependencies in `requirements.txt`.


## Version 1.12.1

This version prevents certain exceptions from being buried and ignored, and improves the network failure retry algorithm.


## Version 1.12.0

Additions in this release:
* New function `network` in the `network_utils` module. It is a companion to `net` and takes the same arguments, but returns only one value (the response). If an error occurs, it raises the error as an exception. This makes it possible for callers to use `network(...)` in somewhat more Pythonic style than `net(...)`,  by wrapping the call to `network(...)` in `try`-`except`.

Changes in this release:
* Removed `slice` from `data_utils` module because it shadows a Python built-in.
* Fixed `hostname`  in `network_utils` to be more general and not hardwire a test for `http`.
* Fixed a bunch of `flake8` warnings.


## Version 1.11.0

Additions in this release:
* New class `CaseFoldSet`, similar to `CaseFoldDict` but â€¦ a set.

Changes in this release:
* Fixed a bug in the class documentation in the `README.md` file.
* Added missing dependency for [twine]() in requirements-dev
* Now using lazy `import`s in more places, for faster load times.


## Version 1.10.0

Changes in this release:

* `data_utils.flattened` now outputs `[]` as the value of dict or mapping keys whose original values are an empty sequence (e.g., when the value of a dict key is `[]`). Previously, it would output `None` as the value, which was an unexpected transformation of the input.

Bug fixes in this release:

* Fixed a bug in `data_utils.flattened` that caused it to ignore the `separator` argument in some cases.
* Fixed a missing import of `freezegun` in `requirements-dev.txt`.
* Pin the imported version of regex 2022.3.2, because more recent versions cause calls to `dateparser` to encounter an error ("regex._regex_core.error: bad escape \d at position 7").


## Version 1.9.5

The main functional change in this release is that error objects returned by `net(...)` will have error message bodies returned by network services, where possible.

Internally, there has been some refactoring of the Makefile and addition of things like GitHub template files.


## Version 1.9.4

This release merely changes the version of httpx required by `requirements.txt`. No other changes.


## Version 1.9.3

This version adds a missing internal function definition in `download(...)`.


## Version 1.9.2

This version changes `pluralized` so that it outputs `0 items` instead of `0 item` if the number of its argument has length 0.


## Version 1.9.1

This version adds more test cases and splits out the requirements for testing/development into a separate requirements file, [`requirements-dev.txt`](requirements-dev.txt).


## Version 1.9.0

Changes in this release:
* New exception `ArgumentError`.
* `net(...)` makes slightly finer distinctions between `ServiceFailure` and `NetworkFailure` when it comes to addresses it can't connect to, and also raises `ArgumentError` in some cases such as passing a `data` keyword argument to a network `get`.
* `on_localhost(...)` logs slightly better debug messages.
* There are more test cases.
* `CITATION.cff` has been corrected and no longer describes the wrong repository.


## Version 1.8.2

This version merely changes a version dependency in `requirements.txt`. No other changes.


## Version 1.8.1

Changes in this release:

* At some point between versions 0.18 and 0.21.1 (current version), the `httpx` package changed the keyword argument named `allow_redirects` to `follow_redirects`, and our `network_utils` module functions broke as a result. This release updates `network_utils` to account for the change.
* The `requirements.txt` file now pins most dependencies to a specific version, to avoid situations where getting a newer version of a package might break existing code.
* The copyright year has been updated in various files.


## Version 1.8.0

This version introduces the `data_structures` module, and a new class, `CaseFoldDict`.


## Version 1.7.3

Changes in this release:

* Fixed a missing f-string in an exception message, plus guarded a few more exception message strings with `antiformat`.
* Added `CITATION.cff` file.
* Updated the `Makefile`.


## Version 1.7.2

Improve `flattened` to handle lists of dict keys.


## Version 1.7.1

Add missing `deprecation` package to `requirements.txt`.


## Version 1.7.0

Changes in this release:

* Beginning with this release, the function `reset()` is deprecated in favor of the function `reset_interrupts()`. 
* The function `wait()` resets the interrupt state before it begins waiting.


## Version 1.6.3

This release fixes some unexpected failures in `flattened(...)`.


## Version 1.6.2

This release expands `flattened(...)` to deal with iterators and generators.


## Version 1.6.1

This release fixes a bug in version 1.6.0.


## Version 1.6.0

This release adds the new function `flattened(...)`


## Version 1.5.0

This release adds the new function `print_boxed(...)`.


## Version 1.4.0

Changes in this version:
* In `net(...)`, in case of a connection error, don't do exponential back-off and retry. Retry only once and then give up, because connection errors often mean the server is not available and long waits are unhelpful to callers.
* Change `net(...)` to not test if a network is available if the given destination address is on the local host. This prevents incorrectly returning `NetworkFailure` when the current host is detached from the network and the failure is actually a `ServiceFailure` (for example, if nothing is listening on the destination port on the local host).
* Add new function `on_localhost(...)`, for testing whether a given network location indicates the local host.

Note: the previous release, 1.3.10, should not have added new functions in a patch release &ndash; API changes should result in changing the minor release number, not merely the patch number. The previous release number was a mistake; it should have been 1.4.0, but since it wasn't, this release is 1.4.0.


## Version 1.3.10

* Add new functions `download(...)` and `download_file(...)`.


## Version 1.3.9

* Don't import packages `dateparser` and `validator_collection` until actually necessary, to reduce application startup times.


## Version 1.3.8

* Fix problems on Windows involving the interrupt handler configured by `config_interrupt(...)`. First, the internal function used did not have a signature that was correct for `win32api.SetConsoleCtrlHandler` on Windows. Second, the proper usage is to return a value, not raise an exception.


## Version 1.3.7

* Make `relative(...)` from `file_utils` more robust against a problem on Windows, in which Python's `os.path.relpath` generates an error when you try to use it on a network-mapped drive.


## Version 1.3.6

* Fix missing `requirements.txt` entry for `pywin32` on Windows.


## Version 1.3.5

* Fix reference to missing function called by `relative(...)`.


## Version 1.3.4

* Fix undefined exceptions in network_utils due to a missing import.


## Version 1.3.3

* Fix broken references to os.path functions.


## Version 1.3.2

* Add a check for a common mistake in parameters to `net(...)`.


## Version 1.3.1

* Remove reference to HTTPX exception `RequestBodyUnavailable`, which no longer seems to exist in current versions of the HTTPX package.
* Remove use of exception `UserCancelled` in `network_utils.py`, because its definition no longer existed elsewhere and on review it seemed unecessary in the context where it was used.


## Version 1.3.0

* Fixed issue #2: httpx Timeout needs a default value.
* Bump the required version of [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org) to 0.16.
* Changed name `filter_by_extension(...)` to `filtered_by_extension(...)` to follow the style of other functions that return values.
* Made trivial changes to the Makefile


## Version 1.2.0

* Added new function `config_path(...)`
* Added more unit tests


## Version 1.1.1

This version makes `antiformat(...)` more robust against values that are not strings, by applying `str(...)` to the incoming value.


## Version 1.1.0

This version adds a start at a module of string utilities, and introduces `antiformat(..)`: a function that will quote instances of `{` and `}` braces in a string so that the string can be passed safely to `format`.


## Version 1.0.0

* Rename a few functions to follow a more consistent naming convention.
* Update `requirements.txt` file.
* Add more documentation.
* Call this a 1.0.0 release.


## Version 0.0.7

* Fix bug in `filename_basename(...)`.
* Improve `plural(...)` by using `pluralize(...)` from [Boltons](https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons) package.
* Remove tests for removed module http_code.
* Miscellaneous other minor fixes and tweaks.


## Version 0.0.6

* Add a new module, `network_utils`.
* Start a collection of exceptions that may be returned by this package.
* Add additional dependency requirements to `requirements.txt`.


## Version 0.0.5

* Add a new module, `module_utils`.
* Add functions to the `file_utils` module.
* The package `__init__.py` file no longer imports the individual modules.  (Users are expected to use the approach `from commonpy.modulename import functionname`.)


## Version 0.0.4

Changed the order of arguments to function `config_interrupt` in the `interrupt` module to be in a more convenient order for most use cases.


## Version 0.0.3

This release adds the module `interrupt`.  This module includes `wait(...)`, a replacement for `sleep(...)` that is interruptible and works with multiple threads.  It also provides methods to cause an interruption (including doing it by issuing a <kbd>^C</kbd> to the program), check whether an interruption occurred, and other related operations.


## Version 0.0.2

Fixed some issues with the `README.md` file and started adding some documentation about the functions.


## Version 0.0.1

First release of various utilities developed for other Caltech Library projects over the last couple of years.
