Commonpy: useful Python functions and utilities
===============================================

This is a collection of common utility functions and classes that we at the Caltech Library have found useful in our other Python projects.

Introduction
------------

This repository does not constitute a single program; instead, it contains a collection of modules with utility functions and classes that we have found ourselves using repeatedly in other Python projects.


Installation
------------

The instructions below assume you have a Python interpreter installed on your computer; if that's not the case, please first [install Python version 3](INSTALL-Python3.md) and familiarize yourself with running Python programs on your system.

On **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows** operating systems, you should be able to install `commonpy` with [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).  To install `commonpy` from the [Python package repository (PyPI)](https://pypi.org), run the following command:
```
python3 -m pip install commonpy
```

As an alternative to getting it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org), you can use `pip` to install `commonpy` directly from GitHub, like this:
```sh
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/caltechlibrary/commonpy.git
```


Usage
-----

The basic approach to using this package is to import the modules and functions you need.  For example:

```python
from commonpy.file_utils import readable

if readable('/path/to/some/file'):
    # do something
```

The following subsections describe the different modules available.


### `data_utils`

This module provides a number of miscellaneous simple functions for some common operations on data of various kinds.

| Function           | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `unique(list)`     | Take a list and return a version without duplicates |
| `ordinal(integer)` | Return a string with the number followed by "st", "nd, "rd", or "th" |
| `slice(list, n)`   | Yield `n` number of slices from the `list` |
| `timestamp()`      | Return a string for an easily-readable form of the current time and date |
| `parse_datetime(string)` | Return a date object representing the given date string |
| `plural(word, n)`  | Simplistic function to append "s" to `word` if `n > 1` |
| `expand_range(string)` | Given a string of the form "X-Y", return the list of integers it represents |


### `file_utils`

This module provides a number of miscellaneous simple functions for some common operations on files and directories.


### `http_code`


### `interrupt`

This module includes `wait(...)`, a replacement for `sleep(...)` that is interruptible and works with multiple threads.  It also provides methods to cause an interruption (including doing it by issuing a <kbd>^C</kbd> to the program), check whether an interruption occurred, and other related operations.


### `module_utils`

### `system_utils`
