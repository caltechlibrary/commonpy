☀ Introduction
-----------------------------

The structure of this module is slightly unusual: it does not have a subdirectory, there is no `setup.py`, and all of the module files are at the top level.  This makes it possible to incorporate this module in other modules using `git submodule add https://github.com/caltechlibrary/commonpy`.
